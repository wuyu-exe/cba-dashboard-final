// ORIENTATION — one long-form page, replacing the seven cards.
//
// Review notes this answers:
//   "Get rid of the cards in this orientation step and instead have 1-2
//    evidence-based paragraphs explaining in detail what each orientation
//    card promises to explain."
//   "The 7 orientation topics could be one editorial page with breaks or a
//    numbered list as opposed to equal tiles."
//
// Every claim that is not definitional carries a `source`, keyed to an entry
// in `bibliography` (see dashboardContent.js) so the reader can chase it.
