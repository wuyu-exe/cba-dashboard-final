  mission: {
    label: "Our philosophy",
    heading: "Nobody should be left worse off",
    lead:
      "Every infrastructure or renewable energy project should be evaluated through a public-interest and fairness lens. Even when a project provides major regional benefits, such as cleaner energy, lower costs, or improved resilience, it can still impose short- and long-term burdens on nearby residents who did not choose to be affected.",
    body: [
      "Fairness means recognizing those impacts and ensuring that the communities who bear them are not left worse off. When a project generates large long-term gains, a small portion of those gains should be used to offset the costs felt by the local community. This is a basic principle of energy justice: those bearing the burden should also receive a fair share of the benefits and be appropriately compensated for their losses.",
      "The public also has a right to know about proposed projects early — before approvals are issued and before construction begins — and to participate at a stage when design, location, technology choices, construction plans, and community benefits can still be shaped. State laws, environmental review requirements, and public-notice regulations protect this right.",
    ],
    principles: [
      "It is not selfishness (NIMBY) that motivates community concerns — it is a desire to be treated fairly.",
      "Projects should be judged not just on meeting minimally acceptable environmental standards, but on maximizing community benefits wherever possible.",
      "This toolkit is more than a technical manual. It stands for the principle that those who bear a project's burdens should share in its gains.",

In the past, some developers have attempted to use SLAPP lawsuits (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) to intimidate or silence community activists. Many states now have anti-SLAPP statutes that allow courts to quickly dismiss these suits and, in some cases, require the developer to pay the defendant's legal fees. The scope of these protections varies by state, and CBAs themselves are legal contracts that may create obligations for the organizations or municipalities that sign them. Individual residents typically do not incur personal liability simply for participating in engagement processes, offering input, or serving on advisory groups. Still, communities should seek legal advice if they have concerns about potential exposure or if a developer threatens litigation.",

  // Case Studies
  { id: "rl-c5", type: "case-study", step: "prepare", title: "Hunter's Point Shipyard, San Francisco", location: "San Francisco, CA", sector: "Mixed-Use Development", outcome: "Enforcement failure", status: "available", description: "The Hunter's Point redevelopment underscores the importance of preparation, particularly assessing long-term capacity, before negotiations begin. Although the CBA included ambitious commitments and an implementation committee, the coalition did not fully assess its ability to sustain oversight of a multi-decade project. When SF ACORN dissolved, the committee lost its independence, and the developer gained disproportionate influence, weakening enforcement. The case shows that without early preparation for organizational stability and support needs, even well-negotiated commitments can unravel." },
  { id: "rl-c1", type: "case-study", step: "engage", title: "Block Island Wind Farm, Rhode Island", location: "Rhode Island", sector: "Offshore Wind", outcome: "Successful enforcement", status: "available", description: "Block Island demonstrates how ongoing, accessible engagement can make later enforcement run smoothly. The CBA established a full-time community liaison who maintained communication throughout development and into operations. Years later, when seabed erosion exposed the transmission cable, the developer responded quickly and collaboratively, honoring the reimbursement clause without resorting to litigation. The case shows that strong engagement builds trust that serves as a practical enforcement tool." },
  { id: "rl-c2", type: "case-study", step: "negotiate", title: "Calverton Solar Energy Center, New York", location: "New York", sector: "Solar", outcome: "Successful enforcement", status: "available", description: "Calverton demonstrates that structuring negotiations within a formal municipal process can create durable leverage. By tying the CBA directly to planning approvals, the town ensured that negotiated commitments were linked to regulatory milestones. When the developer failed to complete landscaping and make payments, the certificate of occupancy was withheld until obligations were met. The case shows that a well-designed negotiation process can embed enforcement power within the project's approval pathway." },
  { id: "rl-c8", type: "case-study", step: "draft", title: "Warm Springs/South Fremont, California", location: "Fremont, CA", sector: "Mixed-Use Development", outcome: "Drafting failure", status: "available", description: "This case demonstrates how drafting failures can undermine otherwise strong community advocacy. The CBA clearly reflected community priorities for affordable housing and local hiring, but later amendments to the broader Community Plan were not formally tied back to the agreement. Because the CBA did not anticipate policy changes or require alignment, key commitments lost protection. The case shows that drafting must anticipate future amendments and build in durability." },
  { id: "rl-c9", type: "case-study", step: "monitor", title: "Salem Wind Terminal, Massachusetts", location: "Salem, MA", sector: "Offshore Wind (Marshalling Terminal)", outcome: "Successful monitoring", status: "available", description: "The Salem Wind Terminal project established a seven-member working group with quarterly meetings and annual public reports, along with a robust monitoring structure staffed by dedicated personnel and ensuring continuity. This framework ensured that commitments were tracked publicly and regularly, reducing the risk of drift or opacity over time and illustrating how formalized, recurring monitoring can sustain accountability throughout a project's lifespan." },
  { id: "rl-c4", type: "case-study", step: "enforce", title: "NECEC Transmission Line, Maine", location: "Maine", sector: "Transmission", outcome: "Successful enforcement", status: "available", description: "NECEC demonstrates enforcement through structured, process-based mechanisms rather than litigation. The agreement included notice-and-cure provisions and regular reporting requirements that endured through years of permitting disputes and legal challenges. These tools ensured that commitments persisted despite delays and political turnover, showing that enforcement can succeed when accountability structures are designed for long-term horizons." },
